# ArduinoCodes

Welcome to the ArduinoCodes GitHub repository! This is my personal collection of Arduino code snippets, where I share code snippets and projects related to Arduino development.
## About

In this repository, you'll find Arduino code examples and projects that I've created. These codes are designed to work with various Arduino boards and modules. Additionally, I often reference resources from Robocore Brazil, a popular online platform for robotics enthusiasts, to enhance my Arduino projects.
## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and use the Arduino code snippets in your own projects. Simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files directly. You can then upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or your preferred development environment.
## Resources

To learn more about Arduino development and robotics, I highly recommend checking out the resources available on Robocore Brazil. They offer a wide range of tutorials, kits, and components for Arduino and robotics enthusiasts.

You can visit Robocore Brazil at https://www.robocore.net.
